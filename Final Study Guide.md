# PHYS 200 Exam 2 Study Guide

## Overview

This exam covers **mechanics** topics including impulse/momentum, energy/work, collisions, springs, and rotational motion. Here's what you need to know:

---

## **Problem 1: Impulse and Momentum**

### Key Concepts

- **Impulse-Momentum Theorem**: $$J = Δp = m(v_f - v_i)$$
- **Impulse from Force**: $$J = F·Δt$$
- **Kinetic Energy**: $$KE = ½mv²$$

### What to Practice

- Calculate change in momentum when velocity changes
- Find average force from impulse and time duration
- Calculate energy lost in inelastic collisions
- Remember: impulse is a vector (same direction as Δv)

### Common Mistakes

- Forgetting to account for direction (signs matter!)
- Not using the change in velocity (Δv, not just final v)
- Mixing up force on wall vs force on car (Newton's 3rd Law - equal magnitude)

## **Problem 2: Conservation of Energy & Work**

### Key Concepts

- **Work by gravity**: $$W_g = mgh = mg·d·sin(θ)$$ [positive going down]

- **Work by friction**: $$W_f = -μ_k·N·d = -μ_k·mg·cos(θ)·d$$ [always negative]

- **Work-Energy Theorem**: $$W_{\text{total}} = ΔKE$$
- **Power**: $$P = \frac{W}{t}$$

### What to Practice

- Identify all forces doing work on an object
- Calculate normal force on an incline: $$N = mg·cos(θ)$$
- Apply energy conservation: if moving at constant velocity, KE doesn't change, so $$W_\text{total} = 0$$
- This means: $$W_\text{applied} + W_\text{gravity} + W_\text{friction} = 0$$
- Calculate power for each force separately

### Common Mistakes

- Forgetting that friction does negative work
- Using wrong angle (use angle from horizontal for sin/cos properly)
- Not recognizing that constant velocity means zero net work
- Forgetting to convert to correct units for power (watts)

## **Problem 3: 2D Collisions**

### Key Concepts

- **Momentum Conservation**: $$p_\text{initial} = p_\text{final}$$(in both x and y)

- **Elastic Collision**: KE is also conserved
- **2D approach**: Break into x and y components separately
- **Impulse**: $$J = Δp = m(v_f - v_i)$$
- **Force**: $$F = \frac{J}{Δt}$$

### What to Practice

- Resolve initial velocities into components
- Apply conservation of momentum in x-direction and y-direction separately
- For elastic collisions, use both momentum and energy conservation
- Express answers as vectors:$$ v = (v_x, v_y)$$ or $$v = v_x î + v_y ĵ$$
- Calculate impulse vector from change in momentum

### Common Mistakes

- Not treating x and y independently
- Forgetting that one object starts at rest (mailbox has zero initial momentum)
- Mixing up angles (70° from which axis?)
- Not expressing final answer in vector component form

### Elastic Collision Formulas (1D, adapt for components)

For elastic collision between m₁ (moving) and m₂ (at rest):

$$ v₁_f = \frac{m₁ - m₂}{m₁ + m₂}v₁_i$$
$$ v₂_f = \frac{2m₁}{m₁ + m₂}v₁_i$$

## **Problem 4: Spring/Elastic Potential Energy**

### Key Concepts

- **Elastic Potential Energy**: $$U_\text{spring} = \frac{1}{2}kx²$$
- **Energy Conservation**: $$KE_\text{initial} + U_\text{initial} = KE_\text{final} + U_\text{final}$$
- **Hooke's Law**: $$F = -kx$$ (force is restoring, opposite to displacement)

### What to Practice

- Apply energy conservation: $$\frac{1}{2}mv² = \frac{1}{2}kx²$$ (when coming to rest)

- Solve for spring constant k
- Calculate stored energy (always positive value, but it's potential energy)
- Find force at maximum compression using $$F = kx$$

### Common Mistakes

- Forgetting the ½ in elastic PE formula
- Sign confusion on force (it opposes the displacement)
- Not recognizing this is energy conservation problem

## **Problem 5: Rotational Motion**

### Key Concepts

- **Moment of Inertia** (point mass): $$I = mr²$$
- **Angular Momentum**: $$L = Iω$$
- **Torque**: $$τ = rF$$ (for tangential force)
- **Rotational Newton's 2nd Law**: $$τ = Iα$$
- **Drag Force**: $$F_\text{drag} = -bv$$ (where v = rω for circular motion)

### What to Practice

- Calculate moment of inertia for rotating objects
- Find angular momentum from I and ω
- Calculate torque from tangential forces (drag acts tangentially)
- Apply τ = Iα to find angular acceleration
- Convert between linear and angular quantities: v = rω

### Common Mistakes

- Using wrong formula for moment of inertia (point mass vs distributed)
- Forgetting that drag force acts tangentially at radius r
- Not recognizing that torque causes angular acceleration (τ = Iα)
- Sign errors (drag opposes motion)

## **General Exam Tips**

### Always Show:

1. **Diagrams** with forces labeled
2. **Equations** before plugging in numbers
3. **Units** in your final answer
4. **Sign conventions** (especially for work, power, forces)

### Calculator Checklist:

- Make sure calculator is in correct mode (degrees/radians)
- Double-check order of operations
- Keep extra significant figures during calculation, round at end

### Unit Awareness:

- Force: Newtons (N) = kg·m/s²
- Energy/Work: Joules (J) = N·m = kg·m²/s²
- Power: Watts (W) = J/s
- Impulse: N·s = kg·m/s
- Angular momentum: kg·m²/s
- Torque: N·m

### Vector Problems:

- Always break into components first
- Use consistent coordinate system
- Express final answers in component form when requested

## **Quick Formula Sheet**

**Linear Motion:**

$$p = mv$$
$$ J = Δp = FΔt$$
$$ KE = ½mv²$$
$$W = F·d·cos(θ)$$
$$ P = \frac{W}{t}$$

**Rotational Motion:**

$$ L = Iω$$
$$ τ = rF = Iα$$
$$ I = mr²$$ (^ point mass)
$$v = rω$$

**Springs:**

$$ F = -kx$$
$$ U = \frac{1}{2}kx²$$

**Friction:**

$$f_k = μ_k·N$$

**Collisions:**

- Momentum always conserved
- Elastic: KE also conserved
- Inelastic: KE lost
