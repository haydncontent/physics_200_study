## Definitions
#### Types of collisions
1. **Elastic**
    - Momentum conserved ✔️
    - Kinetic energy conserved ✔️
    - No deformation (ideal case)
2. **Inelastic**
    - Momentum conserved ✔️
    - Kinetic energy NOT conserved ❌
    - Some energy converted to heat/sound/bending
3. **Perfectly inelastic**
    - Momentum conserved ✔️
    - KE NOT conserved ❌
    - Objects stick together

#### Explosion
Opposite of a collision. Internal forces push fragments apart.
Momentum is still conserved.


## Master Conservation Rule

**Momentum is ALWAYS conserved IF external net force = 0 in the direction analyzed.**
This is true for:
- Elastic collisions
- Inelastic collisions
- Explosions
- Sticking collisions
Even when KE is lost, **momentum still works.**

## Step-By-Step Methods for Collision Types
### A. Perfectly Inelastic (stick together)

#### Equation
$$ (m_A + m_B)v_f = m_B v_{\text{Ai}} +  m_A v_{\text{Bi}} $$
#### KE Lost
$$ ΔK = K_i - K_f = K_i - \frac{1}{2}(m_A + m_B)v_f^2 $$
### B. Elastic Collisions 1D

#### Two equations:
Momentum conservation:
$$ m_Av_A + m_Bv_B = m_Av_A\prime + m_Bv_B\prime $$
 Relative-speed rule:
 $$ v_A - v_B = -(v_A\prime - v_B\prime) $$
 This replaces KE conservation and is easier.

### C. Elastic Collisions 2D
#### Steps:
- Choose x and y axes
- Conserve momentum in **both** directions
$$ ∑p_x = constant $$
$$ ∑p_y = constant $$
- Use **KE** conservation:
$$ \frac{1}{2}m_Av_A^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_Bv_B^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_Av_A^2\prime + \frac{1}{2}m_Bv_B^2\prime $$

## D. Partially Inelastic 
Only ONE equation works:
$$ m_Av_A + m_Bv_B = m_Av_A\prime + m_Bv_B\prime $$
KE must be computed manually.



## Energy Loss in Collisions
The **lost** energy is:
$$ ΔK = K_i - K_f  $$
**Fraction lost:**
$$ \frac{ΔK}{K_i} $$
In perfectly inelastic, this becomes:
$$ \frac{ΔK}{K_i} = 1 - \frac{(m_A + m_B)v_f^2}{m_Av_\text{Ai}^2 + m_Av_\text{Bi}^2} $$


## Center of Mass View 

In the COM frame, all elastic collisions simplify to:
- Objects revers direction
- Speeds remain the same

Hugely helpful conceptual simplifier for advanced problems.
