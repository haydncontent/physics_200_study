## Linear Momentum
$$ p = mv $$
Properties:
- Vector quantity
- Directly proportional to mass and velocity
- Can't be destroyed, only transferred


### Impulse
$$ J = Δp = p_2 - p_1 = F_{\text{avg}} Δt $$

Reason impulse matters:
- Collisions have huge force but very short Δt
- Easier to analyze Δp than F(t)

## Conservation of Momentum
**Momentum is conserved IFF:
- No net external force in that direction
Internal forces *cancel* by Newton's 3rd Law.

```
             Is there an external force in the direction analyzed?
                      |
              +-------+--------+
              |                |
             Yes               No
              |                |
       Momentum NOT       Momentum IS
          conserved         conserved
      (must use forces)   (use p_before = p_after)

```

Examples of *external* forces that break conservation:
- A rocket pushing off the ground (ground  = external)
- A bullet hitting a wall
- A ball rolling on a rough floor (friction = external)

Examples where momentum is conserved:
- Explosions in midair
- Collisions on frictionless ice
- Cart collisions on a frictionless track
- Collisions where the interaction is *very short* (external forces negligible during ∆t)


## Center of Mass (COM)

#### Definition
$$ r_{\text{COM}} = \frac{∑_\text{i=1}^\text{n}m_i r_i}{M_\text{total}} $$

#### Velocity of Center of Mass
$$ v_{\text{COM}} = \frac{∑_\text{i=1}^\text{n}m_i v_i}{M_\text{total}} $$

The center of mass of a two-particle system lies on the line joining the two masses. Here mA > mB, so the CM is closer to mA than to mB.

$$ x_\text{CM} = \frac{m_Ax_A + m_Bx_B}{m_A + m_B} = \frac{m_Ax_A + m_Bx_B}{M}$$
The center of mass lies on the line joining mA and mB. If the two masses are equal (mA = mB = m), then xCM is midway between them. Basically just a weighted average.
$$ x_\text{CM} = \frac{m(x_B + x_B)}{2m} = \frac{x_A + x_B}{2} $$

#### Key fact:
*The center of mass of an isolated system moves at constant velocity **even during a messy collision***

This helps you:
- Predict directions
- Check solutions 
- Solve explosion problems


## When to Use Center of Mass

```
             Are masses moving in multiple directions?
                 |
          +------+------+
          |             |
         Yes            No
          |             |
    Try COM: simplifies      1D momentum is simpler
    vector sums become       (no need for COM)
          easy

```

You *don't* need COM in simple 1D collisions, but it is good for:
- Two objects flying apart
- Fireworks/explosions
- 2D collisions
COM makes ugly problems much easier


## Impulse-Momentum Theorem 
Use impulse when 
- A force acts for a known **time**
- A known **average force** or **force graph vs time** is given
$$ ∫ F(t) dt = Δp $$
