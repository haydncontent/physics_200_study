## Problem 1: Impulse##
The truck reaches a speed of 35 m/s before it slams into the wall of the store.  The truck has a mass of 2000 kg.  
**A: If the speed of the car is reduced to 2 m/s by the collision, what is the magnitude of the impulse on the wall by the car?**

**B: If the collision took 0.3 seconds, what was the magnitude of the force on the wall?**

**C: How much KE was lost in the collision when the thieves broke the windowed wall to enter the store?**
 

## Problem 2: Conservation of Energy##
Each of the 6 heavy crates has a mass of 50 kg and is being slid down the ramp of the loading dock to the 2 getaway trucks.  The angle of the ramp is 25 degrees and is 3.5 meters long.
**A: If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the crates and the ramp is 0.7, what is the work done by friction on the crate as it slides down the ramp at a small non-zero velocity, and how much work is done on the crate by gravity over the same distance?  Be specific about whether the work is positive or negative.**

**B: How much work is done on each crate by the thieves as it slides down the ramp at a small but non-zero velocity and into the truck?**

**C: If all 6 crates get moved in 30 seconds, what is the power in watts over the 30 seconds done by: the thieves, gravity, and friction, separately?  Be specific about the sign for power.**
  
 
## Problem 3: Collision in 2D
The second truck takes the corner too close and clips a mailbox.  The truck was moving at a speed of 20 m/s and hits the mailbox (which is initially at rest) at an angle of 70 degrees.  The truck has a mass of 2150 kg and the mailbox has a mass of 200 kg.  Treat the initial velocity of the truck as being in the positive x direction and the impulse on the mailbox into the positive x and positive y direction.  For each part, express your answer as a vector in component form.
**A: If the collision is perfectly elastic, what is velocity of the mailbox after the collision?**  

**B: What is the Impulse on the mailbox?**

**C: If the collision took 0.1 seconds, what is the force on the mailbox?**
 

## Problem 4: Elastic Energy in Spring
The first truck hits the webbing across the road with a speed of 20 m/s and has a mass of 2150kg.  When the trucks hits the webbing it stretches like an ideal spring.
**A: If the first truck stretches the webbing by 14 meters before it stops, what is the spring constant k of the webbing? Assume that the loss of energy to drag and friction are negligible.**

**B: How much energy is stored in the spring?  Be specific about the sign of the energy.**

**C: What is the elastic force on the truck by the webbing when it is brought to rest?**

 
## Problem 5: Angular Momentum and Torque
The four thieves are bound together into a single mass by webbing and are being spun around in a circle by your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.  Their combined mass is 400 kg and the radius of the circle they are being spun around in is 5 meters, with an angular velocity of 13 radians/s.
**A: What is the moment of inertia of the thieves around the Spiderman and what is their angular momentum?**

**B: If the drag coefficient of the thieves is 25 Ns/m, what is the magnitude of the torque on the thieves due to drag with the air?**

**C: If your friendly neighborhood Spiderman stopped exerting a torque on the thieves to keep them spinning at a constant angular velocity, what would be the initial angular acceleration on the thieves due to drag as they began to slow down?**
