# Newton’s Laws, Forces, Friction, Drag, Circular Motion

## What this section helps you answer

- How to draw a **free-body diagram**
    
- How to choose whether to use **Newton’s 2nd law vs Energy**
    
- How friction and drag forces behave
    
- How circular motion problems work

## Newton’s Laws (Summary)
### **1️. Law of Inertia**

Objects maintain velocity unless acted on by net external force.

### **2. Law of Acceleration**

$$ ∑ F = ma $$
### **3. Law of Action-Reaction

For forces between objects:
$$ F_A = -F_B$$

## Free-Body Diagram

**General procedure:**
1. Isolate the object.
    
2. Draw **all** forces acting on it (not motion, not velocity).
    
3. Choose axes (often align one axis with direction of motion or slope).
    
4. Write Newton’s 2nd law **in components**.

## Common Forces

| Force Type              | Expression                       | Notes                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Weight                  | $$(mg)$$                         | Downward (toward Earth)     |
| Normal                  | $$depends$$                      | Perpendicular to surface    |
| Tension                 | $$depends$$                      | Along rope/string direction |
| Spring                  | $$(F_s = -kx)$$                  | Opposes stretch/compression |
| Static Friction         | $$(f_s \le \mu_s N)$$            | Prevents motion             |
| Kinetic Friction        | $$(f_k = \mu_k N)$$              | Opposes motion              |
| Drag (linear)           | $$(F_D = -bv)$$                  | Low-speed fluids            |
| Drag (quadratic)        | $$(F_D = -\frac12 C\rho A v^2)$$ | Higher-speed motion         |
| Centripetal Requirement | $$(F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r})$$       | Not a force by itself       |

## Friction Details
Static friction increases up to a max value:
$$f_s \le \mu_s N$$
Then becomes kinetic friction:
$$f_k = \mu_k N$$
Object on surface:

## Drag Force (and when to ignore)

| Motion                           | Drag Type                        | Keep/Ignore?            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Slow, small objects in air       | $$(F_D = -bv)$$                  | Sometimes keep          |
| Fast objects, cars, sports balls | $$(F_D = -\frac12 C\rho A v^2)$$ | Often keep              |
| Basic intro projectile motion    | $$none$$                         | Ignore (use kinematics) |

## Circular Motion Force Req
Centripetal acceleration:
$$ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} $$
Net inward force:
$$ F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} $$
this comes from existing forces like *tension, gravity, and normal.*
