## What this section helps you answer

- Which energies are present in a system?
    
- When is mechanical energy conserved?
    
- When must you include non-conservative work?
    
- Choosing between **work–energy** vs **Newton’s laws**.

## Core Energy Definitions

#### Kinetic Energy (linear)
$$ K_l = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$
#### Kinetic Energy (rotational)
$$ K_r = \frac{1}{2} I ω^2 $$
#### Gravitational Potential Energy
$$ U_g = mgh $$
#### Spring Potential Energy (Hooke's Law)
$$ U_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 $$
## Work-Energy Theorem
$$ W_n = ΔK $$
Work done by a force:
$$ W = ∫ F dx $$
If constant:
$$ W = Fdcosθ $$

## Conservation of Mechanical Energy
Energy conserved when **only conservation forces** do work:
$$ K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f $$
Conservative forces:
- gravity
- ideal springs
- electrostatic forces
Nonconservative forces:
- friction
- drag
- collisions
- 
If non-conservative work exists:
$$ K_i + U_i + W = K_f + U_f $$

## Determining If Energy Is Conserved

**Are there any friction or drag forces?**
- **YES** → NOT conserved 
- **NO** → might be conserved

**Is there a collision?**
- **Perfectly inelastic** → NOT conserved
- **Elastic** → kinetic energy IS conserved
- **Partially inelastic** → NOT conserved

**Are external forces doing work?**
- **Work done BY the system (gravity, springs)** → OK
- **Work done ON the system (motors, pushing)** → NOT conserved


## Choosing When to Use Energy vs Forces

**Use energy when:
- Forces are conservative
- You need speeds, not acceleration
- Motion is complicated but force directions are simple
- Work is easier than Newton's laws (springs, ramps)

**Use Newton's laws when:**
- Acceleration is needed
- Forces are not conservative 
- Direction of acceleration changes (e.g., circular motion)
